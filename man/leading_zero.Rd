\title{Function to add leading zeroes to maintain fixed width.}
\usage{
leading_zero(x, digits = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of numeric data that should be fixed width but is 
missing leading zeroes.}

\item{digits}{an integer representing the desired width of \code{x}}
}
\value{
A character vector of length \code{digits}
}
\description{
This function ensures that fixed width data is the right 
length by padding zeroes to the front of values. This is a common problem 
with fixed width data after importing into R as non-character type.
}
\details{
If x contains negative values then the width specified by digits 
will include one space taken up for the negative sign. The function does not 
trim values that are longer than digits, so the vector produced will not 
have a uniform width if \code{nchar(x) > d}
}
\examples{
a <- seq(1,10)
a <- leading_zero(a, digits = 3)
a
