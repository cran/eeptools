\title{
a function to convert numeric factors into numeric class objects
}
\description{
This function allows you to convert directly from a numeric factor to the numeric class in R and strip away the underlying level index of a factor. This makes it safer to convert from factors to numeric characters directly without accidentally misassigning numbers. 
}
\usage{
destring(x)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
a factor with numeric levels
}
}
\details{
This function should only be used on factors where all levels are valid numbers that can be coerced into a numeric class.
}
\value{
a vector of class numeric
}

\section{warning }{
This will force all levels to be converted to characters and then to numeric objects. Leading zeroes will be stripped off and commas will cause errors.
