\title{
function to return the maximum percentage of the cumulative sum represented by a subset of the vector
}
\description{
Returns the proportion of the cumulative sum represented by the number of elements in the vector a user specifies. This allows the user to identify the maximum proportion of the total that only X number of elements may represent in the vector.
}
\usage{
thresh(x, cutoff)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
a numeric vector, missing values are allowed
}
  \item{cutoff}{
the number of elements to look at
}
}

\value{
An integer for the proportion of the vector's sum reached at cutoff
}

\examples{
# for vector
a<-rnorm(100,mean=6,sd=1)
thresh(a,8) #return minimum number of elements to account 70 percent of total
# for df

## The function is currently defined as
function (x, cutoff) 
{
    x <- x[order(-x)]
    xb <- cumsum(x)
    xc <- xb/sum(x, na.rm = T)
    xc[cutoff]
