\title{
Function to replace an arbitrary character like a "*" in redacted data with an NA in R
}
\description{
Redacted education data files often have a "*" character. When importing into R this is a problem, which this function solves in a simple step by replacing "*" with NA, and then converting the vector to numeric.
}
\usage{
remove_char(x, char)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
a vector of data that should be numeric but contains characters indicating redaction forcing R to read it as character
}
  \item{char}{
  The character or character string that should be removed from the vector.
  }
}

\value{
Returns a vector of the same length as the input vector that is numeric with NAs in place of the character.
}

\note{
Future versions could be modified to accomodate other indicators of redacted data.

\examples{
a <- c(1, 5, 3, 6, "*", 2, 5, "*", "*")
