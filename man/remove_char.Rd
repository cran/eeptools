\title{A function to replace an arbitrary character like a "*" in redacted data with an NA in R}
\usage{
remove_char(x, char)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of data that should be numeric but contains characters 
indicating redaction forcing R to read it as character}

\item{char}{the character string that should be removed from the vector.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of the same length as the input vector that is numeric 
with NAs in place of the character.
}
\description{
Redacted education data files often have a "*" character. 
When importing into R this is a problem, which this function solves in a simple 
step by replacing "*" with NA, and then converting the vector to numeric.
}
\note{
Future versions could be modified to accommodate other indicators of 
redacted data.
}
\examples{
a <- c(1, 5, 3, 6, "*", 2, 5, "*", "*")
b <- remove_char(a, "*")
as.numeric(b)
